### Installation
---------------------
Please use the following codes to install *Redeconve*:
```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ZxZhou4150/Redeconve", build_vignettes = F)
```
You may also set `build_vignettes` as `T`, but it may take some time to build the vignette (1 hour or so). If you don't want to build vignette, you can refer to "Redeconve manual" here, which is a simplified manual.

```{r}
browseVignettes("Redeconve")
```
